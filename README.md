# Chip-8 Engine 

This is a personal side project where I've developed a Chip-8 Interpreter to delve into
emulation and SDL for C programming. It's not intended for use by others, programmers,
or any audience besides myself. Currently, it's highly unstable, and I plan to discontinue
it as soon as I successfully run it on my own machine.

Chip8 Engine used the following libraries:
* Dear Imgui: User interface
* SDL Version 2: Graphic rendering
* nativefiledialog: For opening the file dialogue
